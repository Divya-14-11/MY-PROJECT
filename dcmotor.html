    <H2>WHAT IS A DC MOTOR AND HOW IT WORKS ?</H2>
    </P>
    <article id="dcmotor">
        <p>A DC motor is a type of electric motor that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
            It operates on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a
            force, which causes it to rotate. DC motors are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity,
            reliability, and ability to provide precise speed and torque control.</p>
        A DC motor is an important type of electromechanical device that converts electrical energy supplied by direct
        current
        into useful mechanical energy, usually in the form of rotational motion. The working principle of a DC motor is
        based on
        the fundamental law of electromagnetism, which states that when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a
        magnetic
        field, it experiences a mechanical force, and the direction of this force is given by Flemingâ€™s left-hand rule.
        The
        basic construction of a DC motor consists of two main parts: the stator and the rotor (or armature). The stator
        provides
        a stationary magnetic field, either through permanent magnets or electromagnets, while the rotor is the rotating
        part
        that contains windings connected to a commutator. The commutator, in combination with carbon brushes, plays a
        crucial
        role in reversing the direction of current in the rotor windings each half-turn, ensuring that the torque
        produced is
        always in the same direction, which keeps the rotor spinning continuously.

        One of the biggest advantages of DC motors is their ability to provide high starting torque, precise speed
        control, and
        smooth operation. These features make them highly suitable for a wide range of applications. For example, DC
        motors are
        used in electric vehicles for propulsion, in robotics for accurate movement, in conveyor systems for material
        handling,
        and in small appliances such as fans, drills, and toys. There are different types of DC motors, including
        shunt-wound,
        series-wound, and compound-wound motors, each designed to meet specific requirements. Shunt motors are known for
        their
        ability to maintain nearly constant speed regardless of load, making them ideal for applications such as lathes
        or
        blowers. Series motors, on the other hand, deliver very high starting torque, which makes them useful in
        applications
        like electric traction and cranes. Compound motors combine the advantages of both shunt and series motors,
        making them
        versatile for tasks requiring both speed regulation and torque.

        DC motors are also categorized into brushed and brushless types. Traditional brushed DC motors are simpler and
        more
        affordable, but they require regular maintenance due to brush and commutator wear. Brushless DC motors, often
        called
        BLDC motors, eliminate the need for brushes by using electronic controllers to manage current flow, which
        improves
        efficiency, reduces maintenance, and increases the lifespan of the motor. This has made brushless motors
        increasingly
        popular in modern applications such as drones, computer cooling fans, and electric vehicles. Despite the rise of
        AC
        motors and advanced motor drives, DC motors continue to hold a significant place in industry and daily life due
        to
        their
        controllability, reliability, and straightforward design.
