    <article>
        <p>A DC motor is a type of electric motor that converts direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy.
            It operates on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a
            force, which causes it to rotate. DC motors are widely used in various applications due to their simplicity,
            reliability, and ability to provide precise speed and torque control.</p>
