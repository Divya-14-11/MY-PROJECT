                A wire is a slender, flexible strand of metal that is used primarily to conduct electricity and transmit
                signals from
                one point to another. Wires are usually made of conductive materials such as copper, aluminum, or in
                some cases, silver,
                because these metals have low resistance and allow electric current to pass through efficiently. To
                ensure safety and
                durability, most wires are coated or insulated with non-conductive materials like PVC (polyvinyl
                chloride), rubber, or
                Teflon, which prevent accidental shocks, short circuits, and external damage. Wires come in two basic
                types: solid wire,
                which consists of a single solid conductor, and stranded wire, which is made up of many thin strands
                twisted together.
                Solid wires are strong, less flexible, and are often used in permanent installations such as building
                wiring, while
                stranded wires are more flexible, resistant to breaking due to bending, and commonly used in appliances,
                robotics, and
                electronic devices. The thickness of a wire is measured in terms of its gauge (AWG – American Wire
                Gauge, or SWG –
                Standard Wire Gauge), which determines how much current it can safely carry without overheating. Thicker
                wires can carry
                higher currents, while thinner wires are used for smaller loads. Wires are classified into categories
                such as power
                cables, control cables, communication wires, and specialty wires depending on their function. For
                instance, power wires
                are used to transmit electricity in homes and industries, communication wires like twisted pair and
                coaxial cables carry
                data and signals, and specialty wires such as magnet wires are used in motors and transformers. Wires
                are one of the
                most essential elements in electrical and electronic systems, as they form the backbone of electricity
                distribution,
                from large power grids to tiny circuits on a circuit board. However, improper use of wires, overloading,
                or damaged
                insulation can lead to hazards like electric shocks, fires, and equipment failure. That is why selecting
                the correct
                wire type, thickness, and insulation quality is extremely important in any electrical setup. With the
                advancement of
                technology, modern wires are also being designed with fire-resistant, heat-resistant, and eco-friendly
                materials to
                enhance safety and efficiency in energy transmission.

                A jumper wire is a short length of conductor, usually with a protective insulation, that is used to
                establish electrical
                connections between different points in a circuit, especially on devices like breadboards, development
                boards, and test
                equipment. Jumper wires are an essential tool in electronics prototyping and circuit testing because
                they allow quick,
                temporary, and flexible connections without the need for soldering. They are typically made of copper or
                tinned copper
                for good conductivity and are insulated with materials such as PVC or silicone to prevent short
                circuits. Jumper wires
                are available in different forms— <mark>male-to-male, male-to-female, and
                    female-to-female</mark>—depending on the type of pin or
                socket they are meant to connect. The male ends have solid pins that can be inserted into breadboard
                holes or female
                headers on modules, while female ends have sockets that can receive male pins. They also come in
                different lengths and
                colors, which helps in organizing and identifying connections easily during circuit assembly. The
                thickness of jumper
                wires is often around 22 AWG, which fits snugly into standard breadboard holes. In addition to
                breadboards, jumper wires
                are also widely used with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, sensors, and other microcontroller projects, making
                them extremely
                popular in educational, DIY, and hobbyist electronics. Their main advantages include reusability,
                flexibility, and ease
                of use, since they allow quick modifications in circuits without permanent connections. However, because
                they are not
                designed for high current or permanent wiring, they are best suited for low-power electronic circuits.
                In modern labs
                and classrooms, jumper wires play a crucial role in teaching electronics, as they let students and
                engineers experiment
                with different circuit designs safely and conveniently.
